### 07/02/2022 - 18/02/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Learn the basics of Flutter and Dart. Set up initial features and layout of the app. Setup Github to make sure the project is comaptible on both computer and laptop. | a) Setup of Flutter and Dart Framework. b) Setup Github repository. c) Fix initial errors so the project is compatible on both laptop and desktop pc. d) Develop initial layout and some features. | Use offical Flutter and Dart documentation along with Stackoverflow to solve any initial problems. | Overall a good start with a decent grasp of Flutter and Dart. I learned that by using official documentation in text form, I learn a lot better and also focus on making my own solutions compared to videos where I end up copying a lot and not learn very much. | 
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Acquire Raspberry Pi unit along with any neccesary components. Structure how it should be setup and what framework I want to use. Find good learning sources for the framework. | a) Do initial work with Raspberry Pi with trial and error method. b) Secure with second hand sources, that the documentation is up to date and good. c) Make sure the documentation fits the solution I want to make. | Make sure from secondhand sources the documentation is up to date and good. Use trial and error to set up the unit. | I chose the framework Flask which I found out was very popular and well documented. As mentioned above, I will specifically go for text sources, but I learned some videos are neccesary to visualize how a Raspberry Pi unit works. |


### 21/02/2022 - 04/03/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Restructuring of project with MVVM architecture, future development of visualization of data and getting the project ready for API inputs from Raspberry Pi. | a) Restructure for MVVM. b) Implementation of more features. c) DCD creation. | Use offical Flutter and Dart documentation along with Stackoverflow to solve any initial problems. Trial and error method. | The project is becoming increasingly harder, but I am learning a lot. Trying to limit having too many sources of information. As a team, we are making sure to create artifacts we all can benefit from, for example a DCD in unison with others in my team who have IoT and App Dev. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Continuation of Raspberry Pi unit and Flask framework setup. Creation of a DCD. | a) Do initial work with Raspberry Pi with trial and error method. b) Secure with second hand sources, that the documentation is up to date and good. c) Make sure the documentation fits the solution I want to make. | Use documentation, be able to connect via VNC software from my laptop. | Been a rough two weeks because of problems with the Raspberry Pi |

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Set up of API connection to Raspberry Pi unit | a) Testing of Raspberry Pi API to ensure it works. b) Implementation of API in Flutter | Showcase of songs in a list. | During this week, I realized that everything takes more time, than what I estimate. I need to break down my goals as much as possible, otherwise I spend too much time thinking about how to meet the goal in th best way possible instead of doing practical work. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Fixing small errors in Python, such as import. Further learning of the Python language. Be able to find the users playlist and individual songs. | a) Continue on CRUD methods. b) Via documentation, learn the Python setup and syntax better. | Be able to import files and retrieve song data from API | In general I have done the same evaluations as in app development. |

### 21/03/2022 - 01/04/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Setup of UI, so the song currently being played can be seen. Be able to search for a song. | a) Neccesary visual UI to be created. b) Input data in the correct places. | Be able to send a search query to the RaspberryPi. Be able to see the song currently being played. UI structure in place. | All the goals were completed with some time to spare. It's been becoming increasingly easier to implement things since I have restructured my approach. I realized I needed to reduce the clutter, which I did and helped me keeping track of what I need to do. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Specialization of API, so only the neccesary data from Spotify is sent to the app. | a) Understand how Spotify structures their json data. b) Test data to see if it is correct. c) Use the Spotify developer dashboard to double check. | Be able to send the neccesary data to the app. | I had some minor problems, but they were easy to fix, as Spotify is really good at telling you exactly what is wrong. I wasn't using the CRUD methods correctly and I also realized I needed Spotify Premium to use all their API features. |

### 04/04/2022 - 15/04/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | State management, so the UI updates with new data. | Flutter and Dart library using StreamProvider | Correct data needs to be displayed during searching for a song and when a new song is played. | Took a while to wrap my head around state management, but it was surprisingly easy with the StreamProvider library. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Setup of cloud based database and methods to use it. | Use Firebase documentation. | Be able to append, delete and manipulate data in the database. | Firebase documentation is extremely good, so it was quite easy to implement. Python is a really good programming language and both setup of methods for the database and the actual setup went smooth. |

### 18/04/2022 - 29/04/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Connection to the cloud database so the app can send data such as how many users are using the app right now. | Use both Flutter and Firebase documentation. | Be able to send data to the database and make sure the data matches. | I have previous methods I could copy and refactor which made it a relatively fast implementation. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Further development of API functionalities so the database is updated correctly as a user connects to a specific bar. | Reuse and refactor previous methods. | Be able to correctly send requests to the database. | Relatively easy implementation as most of the groundwork has been implemented previously. |

### 02/05/2022 - 13/05/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Cleanup and refactoring of code to make it simpler and cleaner. | Use various programming princlpes. | No recurrence of basically the same code, but with different parameters. | It is important to keep the project and code clean and within scope. It makes it a lot easier to go back to old methods and still be able to understand them. Furthermore it helps to stay up to track of what has been done to the project. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Cleanup and refactoring of code. | Go back and reevaluate the project description and diagrams to see if certain methods and other code need to be refactored, removed or moved. | Make sure all methods are used properly via tests. Compare files with diagrams and project description to see if the current structure of the project makes sense. | I have realized this is a very important thing to do often. This took a lot of time because the project has moved fast and not doing it regularly causes issues, such as not being completely sure if moving code and refactoring could potentially break the program. Doing this often compartmentalizes issues and you don't have to go back to old code and change the entire tree of code. |
