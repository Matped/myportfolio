## Learning plan:

**These learning plans span over two weeks and describe what I want to achieve, how and assesment of successes and problems.**

## Learning plan of 4. sem. project.

### 07/02/2022 - 18/02/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Learn the basics of Flutter and Dart. Set up initial features and layout of the app. Setup Github to make sure the project is comaptible on both computer and laptop. | a) Setup of Flutter and Dart Framework. b) Setup Github repository. c) Fix initial errors so the project is compatible on both laptop and desktop pc. d) Develop initial layout and some features. | Use offical Flutter and Dart documentation along with Stackoverflow to solve any initial problems. | Overall a good start with a decent grasp of Flutter and Dart. I learned that by using official documentation in text form, I learn a lot better and also focus on making my own solutions compared to videos where I end up copying a lot and not learn very much. | 
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Acquire Raspberry Pi unit along with any neccesary components. Structure how it should be setup and what framework I want to use. Find good learning sources for the framework. | a) Do initial work with Raspberry Pi with trial and error method. b) Secure with second hand sources, that the documentation is up to date and good. c) Make sure the documentation fits the solution I want to make. | Make sure from secondhand sources the documentation is up to date and good. Use trial and error to set up the unit. | I chose the framework Flask which I found out was very popular and well documented. As mentioned above, I will specifically go for text sources, but I learned some videos are neccesary to visualize how a Raspberry Pi unit works. |


### 21/02/2022 - 04/03/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Restructuring of project with MVVM architecture, future development of visualization of data and getting the project ready for API inputs from Raspberry Pi. | a) Restructure for MVVM. b) Implementation of more features. c) DCD creation. | Use offical Flutter and Dart documentation along with Stackoverflow to solve any initial problems. Trial and error method. | The project is becoming increasingly harder, but I am learning a lot. Trying to limit having too many sources of information. As a team, we are making sure to create artifacts we all can benefit from, for example a DCD in unison with others in my team who have IoT and App Dev. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Continuation of Raspberry Pi unit and Flask framework setup. Creation of a DCD. | a) Do initial work with Raspberry Pi with trial and error method. b) Secure with second hand sources, that the documentation is up to date and good. c) Make sure the documentation fits the solution I want to make. | Use documentation, be able to connect via VNC software from my laptop. | Been a rough two weeks because of problems with the Raspberry Pi |


### 07/02/2022 - 18/03/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Set up of API connection to Raspberry Pi unit | a) Testing of Raspberry Pi API to ensure it works. b) Implementation of API in Flutter | Showcase of songs in a list. |  |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Fixing small errors in Python, such as import. Further learning of the Python language. Be able to find the users playlist and individual songs. | a) Continue on CRUD methods. b) Via documentation, learn the Python setup and syntax better. | Be able to import files and retrieve song data from API |  |
