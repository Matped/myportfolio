## About me:

Matias MÃ¸ller Pedersen.
- 24 years old.

- Love to create and develop ideas, especially in motivated teams with the option of a lot of sparring and help.

## About the project:

```

# The idea:
An IoT unit that can connect to streaming services and with an API built in to let users set songs in a queue. Main target are bars and other social events.

# The target group of the product:
The bar owners will set up a raspberry pi unit and the customers will be able to put songs in a playlist. The costumers will pay a small sum of money for song tokens, where a percentage goes to the developers, bar owners and for the rights to stream the music. Can be expanded to private people.

# Projects for the idea:
- An app for IOS and Android.
- Webserver with API that users can interact with.
- Webserver that authenticates users.
- General IT security.
