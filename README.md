## About me:

Matias MÃ¸ller Pedersen.
- 24 years old.
- Studying computer science.
- Love to create and develop ideas, especially in motivated teams with the option of a lot of sparring and help.
- Interested in many different areas of IT and technology.
- I like to play video games in my spare time, especially with friends in teamwork based games.
- I like to excercise with different team sports, like Floorball.


## About the project:

```

# The idea:
An IoT unit that can connect to streaming services and with an API built in to let users set songs in a queue. Main target are bars and other social events.

# The target group of the product:
The bar owners will set up a raspberry pi unit and the customers will be able to put songs in a playlist. The costumers will pay a small sum of money for song tokens, where a percentage goes to the developers, bar owners and for the rights to stream the music. Can be expanded to private people.

# Projects for the idea:
- An app for IOS and Android.
- Webserver with API that users can interact with.
- Webserver that authenticates users.
- General IT security.

## Weekly Logbook:

**This logbook spans over one week and are short highligts of what I have done with the project.**

```
## Timeline of 4. sem. project.

# Week 1: 31/01/2022 - 4/02/2022
- Project beginnings with requirements gathering, interests analysis and paperprototype.
- Team creation with Belbin methods, making of team rules and the goal of the project.
- Portfolio beginnings.


# Week 2: 7/02/2022 - 11/02/2022
- Guild meeting with app development. Great sparring and ideas.
- Product meeting intro.
- Flutter and Dart initialization.
- UI conventions created and development of different "pages" in the app.
- Firebase functionality with login and registration.
- Raspberry Pi unit acquired.


# Week 3: 14/02/2022 - 18/02/2022
- More flutter feature implementation.
  - Added an infinite scrolling list with easy API iplementation for future backend development.
- Raspberry Pi components acquired and initilization can begin.
- Meeting with product owner.
 - Showcase minimal viable product and ideas were noted.
 
 # Week 4: 21/02/2022 - 25/02/2022

## Learning plan:

**These learning plans span over two weeks and describe what I want to achieve, how and assesment of successes and problems.**

## Learning plan of 4. sem. project.

### 07/02/2022 - 18/02/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Learn the basics of Flutter and Dart. Set up initial features and layout of the app. Setup Github to make sure the project is comaptible on both computer and laptop. | a) Setup of Flutter and Dart Framework. b) Setup Github repository. c) Fix initial errors so the project is compatible on both laptop and desktop pc. d) Develop initial layout and some features. | Use offical Flutter and Dart documentation along with Stackoverflow to solve any initial problems. | Overall a good start with a decent grasp of Flutter and Dart. I learned that by using official documentation in text form, I learn a lot better and also focus on making my own solutions compared to videos where I end up copying a lot and not learn very much. | 
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Acquire Raspberry Pi unit along with any neccesary components. Structure how it should be setup and what framework I want to use. Find good learning sources for the framework. | a) Do initial work with Raspberry Pi with trial and error method. b) Secure with second hand sources, that the documentation is up to date and good. c) Make sure the documentation fits the solution I want to make. | Make sure from secondhand sources the documentation is up to date and good. Use trial and error to set up the unit. | I chose the framework Flask which I found out was very popular and well documented. As mentioned above, I will specifically go for text sources, but I learned some videos are neccesary to visualize how a Raspberry Pi unit works. |


### 21/02/2022 - 04/03/2022

| Subject | Goal | Technigues and tools | Criterias | Evaluation |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| App Dev with Flutter and Dart. | Restructuring of project with MVVM architecture, future development of visualization of data and getting the project ready for API inputs from Raspberry Pi. | a) Restructure for MVVM. b) Implementation of more features. c) DCD creation. | Use offical Flutter and Dart documentation along with Stackoverflow to solve any initial problems. Trial and error method. | The project is becoming increasingly harder, but I am learning a lot. Trying to limit having too many sources of information. As a team, we are making sure to create artifacts we all can benefit from, for example a DCD in unison with others in my team who have IoT and App Dev. |
| IoT with Raspberry Pi. | Continuation of Raspberry Pi unit and Flask framework setup. Creation of a DCD. | a) Do initial work with Raspberry Pi with trial and error method. b) Secure with second hand sources, that the documentation is up to date and good. c) Make sure the documentation fits the solution I want to make. | Use documentation | Still going with Flask framework and also getting help from guild and my fellow team members. |
